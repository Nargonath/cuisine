#### Shio ramen tare

It's a salty tare.

##### Ingredients

* 1 part carot
* 2 part onion
* 1 part celery
* some leek
* some ginger in fresh stick
* bit of oil
* kombu
* water
* half mug of mirin
* a quarter mug of sake (dry rice wine)
* few drops of light vinegar
* 10 big pinches of salt
* 5 big pinches of sugar

##### Recipe

1.  Cut the carot, onion and celery.
2.  Cook them together with the oil, ginger and leek at medium temperature for a few minutes until you get some color.
3.  Then add some water to cover it up and the kombu and turn the heat to medium-low.
4.  When it reaches a simmer take the kombu out, add the mirin, the sake and the vinegar. Cook that done to a mug of liquid.
5.  Once done, remove the vegetables (you can keep them to cook something afterwards if you like).
6.  Add the salt, the sugar and keep heating it until it all dissolves.
7.  Dilutes 1 tea spoon in 10 tea spoon of water and you are looking for a mild seasoning.
8.  Once it is up to your likings just store it in the fridge.

To cook some of the oils presented below we need some neutral oil. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some:

* Canola oil
* Grapeseed oil

#### Sesame oil

Can be bought easily.
Just had a few drops because it is strong in taste.
